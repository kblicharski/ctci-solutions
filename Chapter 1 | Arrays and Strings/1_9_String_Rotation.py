"""
Problem:
    Assume you have a method is_substring which checks if one word is a
    substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check
    if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to is_substring (e.g.,
    'waterbottle' is a rotation of 'erbottlewat'.

Implementation:
    TODO

Efficiency:
    Time: TODO
    Space: TODO
